// To create a 3D model of a customizable cake with control buttons for different toppings in a React component, you can use a library such as three.js or react-three-fiber.
// Three.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to create and display 3D graphics in the browser. It provides a wide range of features, including 3D geometry, materials, lights, and cameras, as well as support for animations and interactivity.
// React-three-fiber is a React wrapper for three.js that allows you to use three.js in a declarative way with the React library. It provides a set of components that map directly to three.js objects, making it easier to use three.js with React.
// To use either of these libraries in a React component, you will need to install them as dependencies in your project. Then, you can import them and use them to create your 3D model and control buttons.
// Here is an example of how you might use three.js and react-three-fiber to create a 3D model of a customizable cake with control buttons in a React component:

import React from "react";
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from "react-three-fiber";
import { useSpring, a } from "react-spring/three";
import * as THREE from "three";

// create the cake base
const CakeBase = () => {
  const { viewport } = useThree();
  const aspect = viewport.width / viewport.height;
  const [cakeBaseProps, setCakeBaseProps] = useSpring(() => ({
    scale: [1, 1, 1],
    rotation: [0, 0, 0],
    position: [0, 0, 0],
  }));
  useFrame(() => {
    setCakeBaseProps({
      scale: [1, 1, 1],
      rotation: [0, 0.01, 0],
      position: [0, 0, 0],
    });
  });
  return (
    <a.mesh {...cakeBaseProps} castShadow receiveShadow>
      <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="#FFFFFF" />
    </a.mesh>
  );
};

// create the control buttons
const ControlButtons = () => {
  const [selectedTopping, setSelectedTopping] = useState("none");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedTopping("chocolate")}>Chocolate</button>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedTopping("vanilla")}>Vanilla</button>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedTopping("strawberry")}>
        Strawberry
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedTopping("none")}>None</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// create the customizable cake component
const CustomizableCake = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Canvas shadowMap>
        <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
        <pointLight intensity={0.5} position={[10, 10, 10]} />
        <CakeBase />
        <CakeTopping />
      </Canvas>
      <ControlButtons />
    </div>
  );
};

// This code creates a 3D scene with a cake base and a cake topping using the CakeBase and CakeTopping components, and adds control buttons for selecting different toppings using the ControlButtons component.
// To customize the cake topping based on the selected topping, you can use the state management hook useState to track the selected topping, and modify the appearance of the cake topping based on the value of the selected topping.
// Here is an example of how you might modify the CakeTopping component to customize the cake topping based on the selected topping:

// create the cake topping
const CakeTopping = () => {
  const { viewport } = useThree();
  const aspect = viewport.width / viewport.height;
  const [cakeToppingProps, setCakeToppingProps] = useSpring(() => ({
    scale: [1, 1, 1],
    rotation: [0, 0, 0],
    position: [0, 0, 0],
  }));
  const [selectedTopping, setSelectedTopping] = useState("none");
  useFrame(() => {
    setCakeToppingProps({
      scale: [1, 1, 1],
      rotation: [0, 0.01, 0],
      position: [0, 0.5, 0],
    });
  });
  return (
    <a.mesh {...cakeToppingProps} castShadow receiveShadow>
      <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial
        attach="material"
        color={
          selectedTopping === "chocolate"
            ? "#4B0082"
            : selectedTopping === "vanilla"
            ? "#FFFFFF"
            : selectedTopping === "strawberry"
            ? "#FF69B4"
            : "#000000"
        }
      />
    </a.mesh>
  );
};

// This code modifies the color of the cake topping based on the value of the selected topping. You can customize the appearance of the cake topping in other ways, such as by changing the geometry or material of the cake topping, or by adding additional objects to the scene.
