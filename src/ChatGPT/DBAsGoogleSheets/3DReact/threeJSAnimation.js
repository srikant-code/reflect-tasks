// To create a React component with 3D animations, you can use a library such as three.js or react-three-fiber.
// Three.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to create and display 3D graphics in the browser. It provides a wide range of features, including 3D geometry, materials, lights, and cameras, as well as support for animations and interactivity.
// React-three-fiber is a React wrapper for three.js that allows you to use three.js in a declarative way with the React library. It provides a set of components that map directly to three.js objects, making it easier to use three.js with React.
// To use either of these libraries in a React component, you will need to install them as dependencies in your project. Then, you can import them and use them to create your 3D animations.
// Here is an example of how you might use three.js to create a 3D animation in a React component:

import React from "react";
import * as THREE from "three";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const width = this.mount.clientWidth;
    const height = this.mount.clientHeight;

    // create a 3D scene
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();

    // create a 3D camera
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, width / height, 0.1, 1000);

    // create a 3D renderer
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
    renderer.setClearColor("#000000");
    renderer.setSize(width, height);

    // create a 3D cube
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: "#433F81" });
    const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);

    // position the camera
    camera.position.z = 4;

    // animate the cube
    function animate() {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
      cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    }
    animate();

    // add the 3D scene to the DOM
    this.mount.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div
        ref={(mount) => {
          this.mount = mount;
        }}
      />
    );
  }
}

// This example creates a 3D cube that rotates indefinitely. You can customize the animation by modifying the properties of the cube or by adding additional objects to the scene.
