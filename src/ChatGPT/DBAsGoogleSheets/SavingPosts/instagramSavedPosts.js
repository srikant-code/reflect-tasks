// To retrieve saved posts on Instagram using the Instagram API in a React application, you will need to follow these steps:

// Obtain an Instagram API access token:
// First, you will need to create a Facebook developer account and set up a Facebook app.
// Then, you will need to go to the Instagram Basic Display API section in the Facebook Developer dashboard and submit a request for review to obtain permission to use the Instagram API.
// After your request has been approved, you can use the Facebook Login API to obtain an access token that can be used to authenticate API requests.
// Make a request to the Instagram API to retrieve saved posts:
// To retrieve a list of the authenticated user's saved posts, you will need to make a GET request to the /me/saved_media endpoint of the Instagram API, passing the access token in the access_token query parameter.
// This endpoint returns a paginated list of media items that have been saved by the authenticated user.
// You can use the after and before query parameters to paginate through the results.
// Display the retrieved saved posts in your React application:
// After making the request to the Instagram API and receiving the response, you can use the data from the response to display the saved posts in your React application.
// You can use the react-instagram-embed library to easily display Instagram posts in your application.
// Here is an example of how you might use the Instagram API to retrieve and display saved posts in a React application:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import InstagramEmbed from "react-instagram-embed";

const InstagramSavedPosts = () => {
  const [savedPosts, setSavedPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchSavedPosts = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://graph.instagram.com/me/saved_media?access_token=${accessToken}`
      );
      const data = await response.json();
      setSavedPosts(data.data);
    };

    fetchSavedPosts();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {savedPosts.map((post) => (
        <InstagramEmbed
          key={post.id}
          url={`https://www.instagram.com/p/${post.shortcode}`}
          maxWidth={320}
          hideCaption={false}
          containerTagName="div"
          protocol=""
          injectScript
          onLoading={() => {
            // This function is called when the embed is loading.
            // You can use this to display a loading spinner or message.
          }}
          onSuccess={() => {
            // This function is called when the embed has successfully loaded.
            // You can use this to hide the loading spinner or message.
          }}
          onAfterRender={() => {
            // This function is called after the embed has been rendered.
            // You can use this to perform any necessary post-rendering tasks.
          }}
          onFailure={() => {
            // This function is called if the embed fails to load.
            // You can use this to display an error message or handle the error in some other way.
          }}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default InstagramSavedPosts;
