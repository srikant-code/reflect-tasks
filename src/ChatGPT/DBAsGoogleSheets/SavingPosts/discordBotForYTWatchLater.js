// To create a Discord plugin that displays the videos in your YouTube Watch Later playlist, you will need to use the Discord API and the YouTube Data API.
// Here is an example of how you could create a Discord plugin that displays the videos in your YouTube Watch Later playlist when a user types the !watchlater command:
// First, you will need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console to use the YouTube Data API. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the YouTube Data API.
// Install the discord.js library and the google-api-client library using npm:
// npm install discord.js google-api-client
// Create a new Discord bot by following the instructions in the Discord Developer Portal. Make sure to save the bot's token, as you will need it to authenticate with the Discord API.

// Here is the full code to create a Discord plugin that displays the videos in your YouTube Watch Later playlist when a user types the !watchlater command:
// Import the discord.js library and the required types in your plugin file:
const Discord = require("discord.js");
const { google } = require("googleapis");

const YOUR_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const YOUR_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN";
const YOUR_WATCH_LATER_PLAYLIST_ID = "YOUR_WATCH_LATER_PLAYLIST_ID";

// Import the discord.js library and the required types in your plugin file:
const youtube = google.youtube({
  version: "v3",
  auth: YOUR_API_KEY,
});

// Import the discord.js library and the required types in your plugin file:
const client = new Discord.Client();
client.login(YOUR_BOT_TOKEN);

// Create an event listener that listens for messages in the Discord server. This event listener will be triggered every time a user sends a message in the server:
client.on("message", async (message) => {
  if (message.content.startsWith("!watchlater")) {
    const res = await youtube.playlistItems.list({
      part: "snippet",
      playlistId: YOUR_WATCH_LATER_PLAYLIST_ID,
    });
    const videos = res.data.items;

    let response = "";
    for (const video of videos) {
      response += `${video.snippet.title}\n`;
    }
    message.channel.send(response);
  }
});

// Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_BOT_TOKEN, and YOUR_WATCH_LATER_PLAYLIST_ID with your own API key, bot token, and playlist ID, respectively.
