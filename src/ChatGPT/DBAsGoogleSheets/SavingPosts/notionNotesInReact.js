// To get all your notes in a Notion database in a React app, you will need to use the Notion API. Here is a general outline of the steps you can take:
// First, you will need to obtain an API key by creating a new integration in your Notion account settings.
// Next, you will need to install the notion-client npm package, which is a client library for the Notion API.
// In your React app, use the notion-client library to authenticate with the Notion API using your API key.
// Use the notion-client library to fetch the data for your notes from the Notion API. This will involve making a query to the API using the search or query endpoints, depending on the specifics of your database.
// Once you have received the data for your notes from the API, you can use it to populate your React app with the information you need.
// Here is some example code that demonstrates how to authenticate with the Notion API and make a query to fetch data from a database:
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import NotionClient from "notion-client";

const notion = new NotionClient({
  auth: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

function MyNotes() {
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchNotes() {
      const queryResult = await notion.search({
        filter: {
          property: "object",
          value: "page",
        },
      });

      setNotes(queryResult.results);
    }

    fetchNotes();
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {notes.map((note) => (
        <li key={note.id}>{note.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default MyNotes;
// This code will render a list of li elements, each containing the title of a note. You can customize the rendering of each note by adding additional JSX elements or by using other techniques, such as style or className props to apply styles to your elements.
