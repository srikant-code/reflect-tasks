// To create a user onboarding tour in React, you can use a library such as react-joyride or react-tour. These libraries provide components and tools for creating step-by-step tours that highlight specific elements on the page and provide explanations or instructions to the user.
// Here is an example of how you could use the react-joyride library to create an onboarding tour:
import Joyride from "react-joyride";

const OnboardingTour = () => {
  const [steps, setSteps] = useState([
    {
      target: ".element-1",
      content: "This is the first element in the tour",
    },
    {
      target: ".element-2",
      content: "This is the second element in the tour",
    },
    {
      target: ".element-3",
      content: "This is the third element in the tour",
    },
  ]);

  return (
    <Joyride
      steps={steps}
      run={true}
      callback={(data) => {
        if (data.type === "step:before") {
          setSteps((prevSteps) => prevSteps.slice(1));
        }
      }}
    />
  );
};
// In this example, we are using the Joyride component from the react-joyride library to create a tour that consists of a series of steps. Each step is defined by a target element (specified by a CSS selector) and some content to display to the user. The callback prop is used to specify a function that is called at various points during the tour, such as when a step is about to be displayed. In this example, we are using the callback function to remove the current step from the steps array as the tour progresses, so that the tour is only shown once.

// To display a skip button, you can use the showSkipButton prop of the Joyride component and specify a function to be called when the skip button is clicked. You can also use the locale prop to customize the text of the skip button and other elements of the tour.

<Joyride
  steps={steps}
  run={true}
  showSkipButton={true}
  callback={(data) => {
    if (data.type === "step:before") {
      setSteps((prevSteps) => prevSteps.slice(1));
    }
  }}
  locale={{
    skip: "Skip Tour",
  }}
/>;
