// Sure, here is an example of how you can create a Chrome extension that can download streaming videos in a new tab using the Blob interface:

// First, you will need to set up the basic structure of your Chrome extension. This includes creating a manifest file and creating a directory structure to hold your extension's files.

// Next, you will need to create a background script for your extension. This script will run in the background and perform the main logic for your extension.

// You will then need to create a user interface for your extension. This can be done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it can be displayed as a pop-up window or as an overlay on the current page.

// In your background script, you will need to use the Chrome API to listen for events that indicate that a video is being played. When a video is detected, you can use JavaScript to retrieve the video's URL and pass it to the user interface.

// In the user interface, you can provide a button or link that the user can click to initiate the download of the video. When the button is clicked, you can use the Blob interface to create a new blob object containing the video data, and then use the URL.createObjectURL function to create a URL that can be used to download the video.

// To actually download the video in a new tab, you can use the chrome.tabs.create function to create a new tab and navigate to the URL created in the previous step.

// Here is an example of how this could be implemented in the background script:

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.action === "downloadVideo") {
    // Create a new Blob object containing the video data
    const blob = new Blob([request.videoData], { type: "video/mp4" });

    // Create a URL that can be used to download the video
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

    // Create a new tab and navigate to the URL
    chrome.tabs.create({ url: url });
  }
});
