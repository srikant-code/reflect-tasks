// To create a Chrome extension that groups tabs based on their domain, you will need to use the Chrome Extension API. Here is a high-level overview of the steps you will need to follow:

// Create a new folder for your extension and create a file called manifest.json in it. This file will contain metadata about your extension, including its name, version, and permissions.

// Add the following to your manifest.json file to specify the permissions your extension needs:

"permissions": [
    "tabs"
]
// Create a file called background.js in your extension folder. This file will contain the code that runs in the background and is responsible for grouping the tabs.

// In background.js, use the chrome.tabs.query function to get a list of all the open tabs. This function takes an object as an argument that specifies the properties of the tabs you want to retrieve. For example, you can use the url property to filter the tabs by domain.

// Once you have the list of tabs, you can iterate through them and group them based on their domain. You can use an object to store the tabs for each domain, with the domain name as the key.

// To create a new window for each group of tabs, use the chrome.windows.create function. This function takes an object as an argument that specifies the properties of the new window, such as its size and position.

// To move the tabs into the new window, use the chrome.tabs.move function. This function takes an array of tab objects and an object that specifies the properties of the new window.

// Test your extension by loading it into Chrome and opening a few tabs from different domains.

// Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to group tabs based on their domain:


chrome.tabs.query({}, function(tabs) {
  // Create an object to store the tabs for each domain
  var tabsByDomain = {};

  // Iterate through the tabs and group them by domain
  for (var i = 0; i < tabs.length; i++) {
    var tab = tabs[i];
    var url = new URL(tab.url);
    var domain = url.hostname;

    if (!tabsByDomain[domain]) {
      tabsByDomain[domain] = [];
    }
    tabsByDomain[domain].push(tab);
  }

  // Create a new window for each group of tabs
  for (var domain in tabsByDomain) {
    var domainTabs = tabsByDomain[domain];
    chrome.windows.create({
      tabId: domainTabs[0].id,
      focused: true
    }, function(newWindow) {
      // Move the other tabs into the new window
      for (var i = 1; i < domainTabs.length; i++) {
        chrome.tabs.move(domainTabs[i].id, {
          windowId: newWindow.id,
          index: -1
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
