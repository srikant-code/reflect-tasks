// 'Creating pair programming code editor using websocket and react.

// Pair
// programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work
// together at one workstation. One programmer, the driver, writes code while the
// other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
// The two programmers switch roles frequently to ensure that both are able to work
// on all parts of the project.

// To create a pair programming code editor using
// websockets and React, you will need to do the following:

// Set up a websocket
// server that allows real-time communication between the two clients
// (programmers). You can use a library like ws or socket.io to set up the
// websocket server.

// Use React to build the code editor interface. You can use a
// library like CodeMirror or Ace to add syntax highlighting and other code editing
// features to the interface.

// Use the websocket connection to sync the code
// between the two clients. When one client makes a change to the code, send the
// updated code to the server via the websocket connection. The server can then
// broadcast the updated code to the other client, which can use it to update their
// copy of the code.

// Add features like a chat window or screen sharing to
// facilitate communication between the two programmers.

// This is just a
// high-level overview of the process. There are many details involved in building
// a pair programming code editor, and you may need to do additional research and
// development to get everything working as desired.

// node js code

// Here is an
// example of how you might set up a websocket server using Node.js and the ws
// library:


const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {

  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received message:
${message}`);
    ws.send(`Echo: ${message}`);
  });

  ws.send('Welcome to the websocket server!');
});


// This code creates a websocket server that
// listens for connections on port 8080. When a client connects, the server sets up
// a message event handler that logs the received message and sends an "echo"
// message back to the client.

// You can use the ws object to send and receive
// messages between the server and the client. For example, you can send messages
// from the client like this:


const ws = new
  WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.send('Hello, server!');
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log(`Received message:
${event.data}`);
};


// This code creates a new websocket connection to the
// server and sends a message when the connection is opened. It also sets up an
// event handler that logs any messages received from the server.

// I hope this
// helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

// react code for pair programming
// editor with websockets

// Here is an example of how you might use React to build
// a pair programming code editor that uses websockets to sync the code between the
// two clients:


import React, { useState, useEffect } from
  'react';
import CodeMirror from 'codemirror';
import 'codemirror/mode/javascript/javascript';
import 'codemirror/lib/codemirror.css';
import 'codemirror/theme/monokai.css';

const PairProgrammingEditor = () => {

  const [code, setCode] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new
      WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

    ws.onopen = () => {
      ws.send('Hello, server!');
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      setCode(event.data);
    };


    const editor = CodeMirror(document.getElementById('editor'), {
      value:
        code,
      mode: 'javascript',
      theme: 'monokai',
      lineNumbers: true,

    });

    editor.on('change', (instance, change) => {

      ws.send(instance.getValue());
    });
  }, []);

  return (

    <div id="editor"></div>

  );
};

export default PairProgrammingEditor;


// This component uses the
// CodeMirror library to create a code editor with syntax highlighting and other
// features. It also sets up a websocket connection to the server and sends a
// message when the connection is opened.

// The component uses the useEffect hook
// to set up the websocket connection and the CodeMirror editor when the component
// is rendered. It also sets up an event handler that listens for changes to the
// code and sends the updated code to the server via the websocket
// connection.

// When the component receives a message from the server via the
// websocket connection, it updates the code state using the setCode function. This
// causes the CodeMirror editor to update with the new code.

// I hope this helps!
// Let me know if you have any questions.

// Can two users simultaneously edit the
// code and see live previews in each other system? please modify the code
// accordingly if required. 

// Yes, it's possible to allow two users to
// simultaneously edit the code and see live previews in each other's systems.
// Here's an example of how you might modify the code to achieve this:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import CodeMirror from 'codemirror';
import 'codemirror/mode/javascript/javascript';
import 'codemirror/lib/codemirror.css';
import 'codemirror/theme/monokai.css';

const PairProgrammingEditor = () => {

  const [code, setCode] = useState('');
  const [otherUserCode,
    setOtherUserCode] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new
      WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");

    ws.onopen = () => {
      ws.send('Hello, server!');
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {

      setOtherUserCode(event.data);
    };

    const editor =
      CodeMirror(document.getElementById('editor'), {
        value: code,
        mode:
          'javascript',
        theme: 'monokai',
        lineNumbers: true,
      });


    editor.on('change', (instance, change) => {
      setCode(instance.getValue());

      ws.send(instance.getValue());
    });
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (code
      !== otherUserCode) {
      editor.setValue(otherUserCode);
    }
  },
    [otherUserCode])

  return (

    <div id="editor"></div>

  );
};

export default PairProgrammingEditor;


// This code is similar to
// the previous example, but it has an additional state variable otherUserCode to
// hold the code that is sent by the other user.

// When the component receives a
// message from the server via the websocket connection, it updates the
// otherUserCode state variable using the setOtherUserCode function.

// And then
// with the useEffect hook, if otherUserCode is different than the code, it updates
// the editor with the value of otherUserCode so that both users can see live
// previews of the code in each other's systems.

// It's important to note that
// this is just one way to implement this feature, and you may need to make
// additional changes depending on your specific requirements.

// It's also
// important to note that this code is for demonstration purposes and is not
// complete, it doesn't cover the error handling cases and other important details
// that should be considered in a real-world implementation, like multiple
// connected users and security concerns.

// won't there be conflicts if one user
// tries to add something and other user is deleting the same text at the same
// time? is this code able to handle that scenario? if yes the also give the ws
// server code.

// If two users try to edit the same part of the code at the same
// time, there is a risk of conflicts. The code I provided in my previous answer is
// not able to handle this scenario and there will be conflicts.

// One way to
// handle conflicts is to use a version control system (VCS) like Git, and use it
// to merge the changes made by the two users. This approach would involve creating
// a Git repository on the server and having each client push their changes to the
// repository. When a conflict occurs, Git will automatically try to merge the
// changes, and if it cannot do so automatically, it will prompt the users to
// resolve the conflict manually.

// Another way to handle conflicts is to use
// Operational Transformation (OT). OT is a technique used to resolve conflicts in
// real-time collaborative editing systems. It allows multiple users to edit the
// same document simultaneously and ensures that the changes made by each user are
// propagated to all other users in a consistent way.

// Here is an example of how
// you might use the ot library to handle conflicts in your pair programming code
// editor:


const WebSocket = require('ws');
const ot =
  require('ot');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

const
  doc = new ot.Doc();

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message',
    (message) => {
      console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
      const operation
        = JSON.parse(message);
      doc.submitOp(operation);

      ws.send(JSON.stringify(doc.getSnapshot()));
    });


  ws.send(JSON.stringify(doc.getSnapshot()));
});


// This code creates a new
// ot.Doc object, which represents the document that the two users are editing.
// When a client connects, it sends the current snapshot of the document to the
// client, and when the client sends an operation, it submits the operation to the
// document and sends the updated snapshot back to the client.

// The ot library is
// able to handle conflicts by applying the operations in a way that preserves the
// intent of each user.

// It's important to note that this is just one way to
// implement this feature, and you may need to make additional changes depending on
// your specific requirements.
// Also it's worth mentioning that there are other
// libraries available for OT, some of them are more advanced and better suited for
// different use cases.

// does using ot require any react code changes that you
// shared above? if yes please send updated code

// Yes, using Operational
// Transformation (OT) would require changes to the React code I provided in my
// previous answer. Here's an example of how you might modify the React code to
// use OT:


import React, { useState, useEffect } from
  'react';

    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      const newWs = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
      setWs(newWs);


      newWs.onopen = () => {

    }, [code])

    const
      handleChange = (instance, change) => {

    return (

      <div id="editor">

          <div className="error">{error.message}</div>
        }
        <CodeMirror value={code} onChange={handleChange} options={{

      </div>

    );
  };

export default PairProgrammingEditor;


// This code adds error
// handling by using a try-catch block when parsing the message received from the
// server, and by setting an error state variable when an error occurs. It also
// displays an error message on the page when an error occurs.

// In addition, it
// also adding the onclose event to the WebSocket which will be triggered when the
// connection is closed, it sets the error state variable with the event
// object.

// To add security considerations to this code, you should consider the
// following:

// Use secure websocket protocol (wss) instead of unsecured (ws)
// Use
// a secure connection when communicating with the websocket server
// Use
// authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users
// can access the pair programming editor
// Validate user input to prevent
// cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
// Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to
// prevent cross-site scripting and other types of injection attacks
// Tell me more
// on how to do this. Share code wherever necessary. 

// 1. Use secure websocket
// protocol (wss) instead of unsecured (ws)
// 2. Use a secure connection when
// communicating with the websocket server
// 3. Use authentication and authorization
// mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the pair programming
// editor - Give code with firebase authentication and authorization using same
// node js server where ws is present.
// Use secure websocket protocol (wss) instead
// of unsecured (ws)

// To use the secure websocket protocol (wss) instead of the
// unsecured (ws) protocol, you need to set up an SSL certificate on your server.
// The SSL certificate is used to encrypt the data sent between the client and the
// server, making it more secure. Once you have set up the SSL certificate, you can
// use the wss protocol instead of ws in your React code. For example:


const newWs = new WebSocket('wss://localhost:8080');

// Use a secure
// connection when communicating with the websocket server

// To use a secure
// connection when communicating with the websocket server, you can use the https
// module in Node.js to create an HTTPS server. Here is an example of how you might
// set up an HTTPS server:


const https = require('https');
const
  fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key:
    fs.readFileSync('path/to/private.key'),
  cert:
    fs.readFileSync('path/to/certificate.crt')
};

https.createServer(options,
  (req, res) => {
    // Your server code here
  }).listen(8080);


// This code
// creates an HTTPS server using the https module, and it uses the fs module to
// read the private key and certificate files. Make sure to replace
// 'path/to/private.key' and 'path/to/certificate.crt' with the actual path of
// your files.

// Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that
// only authorized users can access the pair programming editor

// To use
// authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users
// can access the pair programming editor, you can use a third-party service like
// Firebase Authentication. Firebase Authentication provides a simple and secure
// way to authenticate users in your app. Here is an example of how you might use
// Firebase Authentication to authenticate users in your Node.js server:

const FirebaseAuth = require('firebase-auth-node');
const auth = new
  FirebaseAuth({
    email: 'your-email',
    password:
      'your-password',
  });

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const token =
    req.headers.authorization;
  auth.verifyIdToken(token)
    .then((decodedToken) => {
      req.user = decodedToken;
      next();
    })
    .catch((error) => {

      res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
    });
});

// firebase
// authentication using google and github signin & react. It should also give
// option to save code to github as gists, with co-author as the loggedIn use
// email.

// Using Firebase Authentication, you can enable users to sign in to your
// app using their Google and GitHub accounts, as well as other popular providers
// like Facebook and Twitter. Here's an example of how you might use Firebase
// Authentication in your React app to enable Google and GitHub sign-in:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useFirebase } from
  'react-redux-firebase';
import { useHistory } from
  'react-router-dom';

const SignIn = () => {
  const firebase =
    useFirebase();
  const history = useHistory();
  const [error, setError] =
    useState(null);

  const handleGoogleSignIn = () => {
    firebase
      .login({
        provider: 'google', type: 'popup'
      })
      .then(() => {

        history.push('/');
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        setError(err.message);
      });

  };

  const handleGithubSignIn = () => {
    firebase
      .login({
        provider:
          'github', type: 'popup'
      })
      .then(() => {
        history.push('/');
      })

      .catch((err) => {
        setError(err.message);
      });
  };

  return (

    <div>

      <button onClick="{handleGoogleSignIn}">Sign in with Google</button>

      <button onClick="{handleGithubSignIn}">Sign in with GitHub</button>
      {error
        &&
        <div>{error}</div>
      }

    </div>

  );
};

export default SignIn;


// This code uses the useFirebase hook
// from the react-redux-firebase library to access the Firebase instance, and the
// useHistory hook from the react-router-dom library to navigate the user to the
// home page after they

// where is the code to save the code that was
// pairprogrammed in github gists and co-authour as loggedIn email?

// Saving the
// code that was pair-programmed to GitHub Gists and adding the logged-in user as a
// co-author can be done by making API calls to the GitHub Gists API. Here's an
// example of how you might do this in your Node.js server:


const axios = require('axios');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const
  saveToGithub = async (code, user) => {
    try {
      // Decode the Firebase ID token to get the user's email
      const decodedToken = jwt.decode(user.token);
      const
        email = decodedToken.email;

      // Create the Gist
      const response = await
        axios.post('https://api.github.com/gists', {
          description: 'Pair-programmed code',
          public: true,
          files: {
            'code.js': {
              content: code
            }
          },

          co-authors: [email] });
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {

    console.error(error);
  }
};


// This code uses the axios library to make a
// POST request to the GitHub Gists API to create a new Gist, with the
// pair-programmed code as the content and the logged-in user's email as a
// co-author. It uses the jsonwebtoken library to decode the Firebase ID token to
// get the user's email.

// It's worth noting that GitHub Gist API doesn't
// support co-authors feature. So it's not possible to add co-author using Gist
// API. But you can use the user object to get the user's email and add it as a
// comment or in the description or somewhere in the file, so the person reviewing
// the code will know the co-author.

// It's important to note that this is just
// an example, and you will need to customize this code to work with your specific
// requirements and also make sure that you have the correct credentials to access
// the GitHub API and also make sure you follow the rate limits for the API.

// 4.
// Validate user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
// 5. Use a
// Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting and other types of
// injection attacks

// Give more information on this and if code changes required
// then please share/
// Validate user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS)
// attacks

// Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection attack
// where an attacker injects malicious code into a web page viewed by other users.
// To prevent XSS attacks, it's important to validate user input to ensure that it
// doesn't contain any malicious code.
// One of the most common ways to validate
// user input is by using a library like sanitize-html, which can be used to remove
// any potentially dangerous tags or attributes from user input.
// You can also use
// a escape() function to convert user input into a safe string that can be safely
// displayed on a web page.

// Here's an example of how you might use the
// sanitize-html library to validate user input in a React component:


import React, { useState } from 'react';
import sanitizeHtml from
  'sanitize-html';

const CommentForm = () => {
  const [comment, setComment]
    = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const sanitizedComment = sanitizeHtml(comment);
    // Save the sanitized comment to the database or display it on the page
  };

  return (

    <form onSubmit="{handleSubmit}">

      <textarea value={comment} onChange={(e) => setComment(e.target.value)} />

      <button type="submit">Post Comment</button>

    </form>

  );
};

export default CommentForm;

// Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)
// to prevent cross-site scripting and other types of injection attacks

// A
// Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps to prevent
// cross-site scripting (XSS) and other types of injection attacks by specifying
// which sources of content are allowed to be loaded by a web page. By setting a
// CSP, you can prevent the browser from loading malicious scripts or other types
// of content that might be injected into your web page by an attacker.

// To use a
// CSP, you need to set the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header in the response
// sent by your server. Here's an example of how you might set a CSP in an
// Express.js server:


const express = require('express');
const
  app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {

  res.set('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
  next();
});
'
