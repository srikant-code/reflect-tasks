// To get all tasks present in your Google Tasks and display them in a React app, you will need to use the Google Tasks API. Here is a general outline of the steps you will need to follow:

// Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Tasks API. You will need to create a project and enable the Tasks API in the Google Cloud Console.

// Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials. In order to authenticate your app with the Google Tasks API, you will need to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials, such as a client ID and client secret.

// Authenticate the user and obtain an access token. Use the OAuth 2.0 credentials to authenticate the user and obtain an access token, which will allow your app to access the user's Google Tasks.

// Make a request to the Tasks API. Use the access token to make a request to the Tasks API to retrieve the user's tasks. You can use the tasks.list method to get a list of all tasks for a given task list.

// Display the tasks in your React app. Once you have retrieved the tasks from the API, you can use React to display them in your app. You can create a component to represent each task and render a list of these components using the map function.

// Here is the complete React code that combines the Google Sign-In and Google Tasks API to allow users to sign in with their Google account and view their tasks:
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

const Tasks = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const onSignIn = (googleUser) => {
    const idToken = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token;
    console.log("ID token: " + idToken);

    useEffect(() => {
      const getTasks = async () => {
        try {
          // Replace YOUR_TASK_LIST_ID with the ID of the task list you want to retrieve tasks from
          const tasksResponse = await axios.get(
            "https://www.googleapis.com/tasks/v1/lists/YOUR_TASK_LIST_ID/tasks",
            {
              headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${idToken}`,
              },
            }
          );
          setTasks(tasksResponse.data.items);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
        }
      };
      getTasks();
    }, []);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Configure the Google Sign-In button. Add a Google Sign-In button to your app by including the following code in your React component: */}
      <div
        className="g-signin2"
        data-onsuccess="onSignIn"
        data-theme="dark"
      ></div>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task) => (
          <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Tasks;

// Here is the complete React code that combines the Google Sign-In and Google Tasks API to allow users to sign in with their Google account and view their tasks:

// To add Google authentication to your React app so that users who are logged in can see their tasks, you will need to use the Google Sign-In JavaScript library. Here is a general outline of the steps you will need to follow:

// Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Sign-In API. You will need to create a project and enable the Google Sign-In API in the Google Cloud Console.

// Add the Google Sign-In library to your React app. You can include the Google Sign-In library in your app by adding the following script tag to the head of your HTML file:

// <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script>

// Configure the Google Sign-In button. Add a Google Sign-In button to your app by including the following code in your React component:
// <div className="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn" data-theme="dark"></div>

// Implement the onSignIn function. The onSignIn function will be called when the user successfully signs in with Google. You can use this function to retrieve the user's Google profile and access token, which you can then use to make requests to the Google Tasks API on behalf of the user:

// const onSignIn = googleUser => {
//     const profile = googleUser.getBasicProfile();
//     console.log('ID: ' + profile.getId()); // Do not send to your backend! Use an ID token instead.
//     console.log('Name: ' + profile.getName());
//     console.log('Image URL: ' + profile.getImageUrl());
//     console.log('Email: ' + profile.getEmail()); // This is null if the 'email' scope is not present.

//     const idToken = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token;
//     console.log('ID token: ' + idToken);
//   };

//   Make requests to the Google Tasks API. Once you have retrieved the user's access token, you can use it to make requests to the Google Tasks API on behalf of the user. For example, you can use the tasks.list method to retrieve a list of the user's tasks:

//   const getTasks = async () => {
//     try {
//       const tasksResponse = await axios.get(
//         'https://www.googleapis.com/tasks/v1/lists/YOUR_TASK_LIST_ID/tasks',
//         {
//           headers: {
//             Authorization: `Bearer ${idToken}`
//           }
//         }
//       );
//       setTasks(tasksResponse.data.items);
//     } catch (error) {
//       console.error(error);
//     }
//   };
