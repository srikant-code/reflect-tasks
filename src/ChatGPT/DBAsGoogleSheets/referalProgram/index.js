// Sure! Here's a general outline for creating a referral program for a React app:
// Determine the goals of your referral program. Do you want to increase user acquisition, engagement, or retention? Having clear goals will help you design the program in a way that aligns with your overall business objectives.
// Choose a reward structure. Will you offer a discount or a free product/service to referred users? Will you also offer a reward to the referring user?
// Decide how you will track referrals. Will you use unique referral codes or links, or will you track referrals through email addresses or account connections?
// Integrate the referral program into your app. You'll need to add a way for users to access and share their referral codes or links, as well as a way for new users to enter referral codes at signup.
// Promote the referral program to your users. Make sure your users know about the referral program and how to participate by promoting it in-app and through email or social media.
// Monitor and optimize the referral program. Keep track of how well the referral program is performing and make adjustments as needed to improve its effectiveness.

// Here's an example of how you might implement a referral program in a React app using unique referral codes:
// First, create a database to store referral codes and track which users have used them. You might store this information in a table with columns for the referral code, the user who created the code, and the user who used the code.
// Next, create a form in your app that allows users to generate and share their referral codes. This form could include a field for the user to enter their email address, as well as a button to generate a unique referral code. You can use a library like uuid to generate unique codes.

// import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
// function generateReferralCode() {
//   return uuidv4();
// }

// When the user clicks the "Generate Code" button, you can save the referral code to the database and display it to the user so they can share it with their friends. You might also want to provide a way for the user to copy the referral code to their clipboard or share it directly through social media or email.
// When a new user signs up for your app, you'll need to add a way for them to enter a referral code. This might be a field in the signup form where they can enter the code, or it could be a separate page where they can enter the code after signing up.
// When the user submits the referral code, you can check the database to see if the code is valid and has not already been used. If the code is valid, you can apply the referral reward (e.g., a discount or free product) to the user's account and update the database to reflect that the code has been used.
// I hope this gives you a sense of how you might implement a referral program in a React app. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more detailed instructions.

// Sure! Here's a general outline for implementing a referral program in a React app using Firebase:
// Set up a Firebase project and install the Firebase SDK in your React app.
// Determine the goals of your referral program and choose a reward structure as described in the previous answer.
// Create a database in Firebase to store referral codes and track which users have used them. You might create a collection called "referralCodes" with documents that contain the referral code, the user who created the code, and the user who used the code.
// In your React app, create a form that allows users to generate and share their referral codes. When the user clicks the "Generate Code" button, use the Firebase SDK to save the referral code to the "referralCodes" collection in the database.
// When a new user signs up for your app, add a field for them to enter a referral code. When the user submits the referral code, use the Firebase SDK to query the "referralCodes" collection to check if the code is valid and has not already been used. If the code is valid, apply the referral reward to the user's account and update the database to reflect that the code has been used.

// Here's an example of how you might create a React component that generates and displays a referral code using Firebase:
// This component uses the useFirebase hook from the react-redux-firebase library to access the Firebase instance, and the useState hook to manage the state of the referral code. When the user clicks the "Generate Referral Code" button, the generateReferralCode function is called. This function generates a unique referral code using the uuid library, and then saves it to the Firebase database under the referralCodes collection. The referral code is also stored in the component's state using the setReferralCode function. If the referral code has already been generated, the component will display the code to the user.

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useFirebase } from "react-redux-firebase";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

function ReferralCodeGenerator() {
  const firebase = useFirebase();
  const [referralCode, setReferralCode] = useState("");

  function generateReferralCode() {
    const code = uuidv4();
    firebase.set(`referralCodes/${code}`, {
      user: firebase.auth().currentUser.uid,
      used: false,
    });
    setReferralCode(code);
  }

  function verifyReferralCode(code) {
    firebase.get(`referralCodes/${code}`).then((doc) => {
      if (doc.exists && !doc.data().used) {
        firebase.update(`referralCodes/${code}`, { used: true });
        firebase.update(`users/${doc.data().user}/points`, {
          points: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.increment(100),
        });
      } else {
        console.log("Invalid referral code");
      }
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {referralCode ? (
        <p>Your referral code is: {referralCode}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={generateReferralCode}>Generate Referral Code</button>
      )}
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          verifyReferralCode(e.target.referralCode.value);
        }}
      >
        <label htmlFor="referralCode">Enter referral code:</label>
        <input type="text" name="referralCode" />
        <button type="submit">Verify referral code</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

// Here's an example of how you might update the referral code generator component to verify referral codes and update the points of the referrer in Firebase:
// This component now includes a form that allows a new user to enter a referral code and submit it for verification. When the form is submitted, the verifyReferralCode function is called with the entered referral code. This function uses the Firebase SDK to retrieve the referral code document from the database, and checks whether the code is valid and has not already been used. If the code is valid, the function updates the used field in the referral code document to true, and increments the points of the referrer by 100 using the FieldValue.increment method.
